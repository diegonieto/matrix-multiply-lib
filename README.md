Matrix Multiply Lib
===================

This is a tiny library focused on the double precision matrix multiplication. The aim of this library is to compare two differents algorithms, the naive and the optimized. Once you have executed the benchmark test you can check how the speed-up can reach even 20x.

Usage
-----

    cd build
    make
    ./mxm
